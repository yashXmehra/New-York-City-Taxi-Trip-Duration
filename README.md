The aim of this project is just to explore the dataset and generate insights from it. 

Here is the description of all the variables / features available in the dataset which will help you to perform EDA:

    id - a unique identifier for each trip
    vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record
    pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged
    dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged
    passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
    pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
    pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
    dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged
    dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged
    store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip)
    trip_duration - (target) duration of the trip in seconds
